	<h1>Kira Barrett</h1>
	<p>Hard-working. Forward-Thinking. Friendly.</p>
	<p>Wrangler of Wordpress and Cascade CMS’, enthusiastic student of JavaScript, and effective communicator with the gift of gab. My colleagues and supervisors describe me as curious, hard-working, and a trusted critical thinker. Outside of the 9 to 5, you can catch me hiking Atlanta’s urban trails or coaxing my garden into bloom. Drop a line if you’ve got a cool opportunity or want to connect!</p>
